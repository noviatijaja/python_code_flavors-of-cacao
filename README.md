🎯 Objectives
✔ Identify the key factors that contribute to chocolate ratings.
✔ Analyze the impact of cocoa percentage, ingredients, and regional influences.
✔ Develop data-driven insights to help chocolate makers refine formulations and enhance product quality.

🔎 Key Questions
Does a higher cocoa percentage lead to better ratings?
Which companies and countries produce the highest-rated chocolate?
How do ingredient combinations impact chocolate ratings?
Are artisanal brands better rated than mass-market chocolate producers?
📊 Data Overview
The dataset is sourced from the Flavors of Cacao Chocolate Database, containing:
✔ 2,693 chocolate bars reviewed by experts.
✔ Information on cocoa percentage, company location, bean origin, and ingredient composition.
✔ Ratings based on expert evaluations of flavor, texture, and overall quality.

🛠️ Tools & Methodology
🔹 Tools Used:
✔ Tableau Public – Data visualization & interactive dashboards.
✔ Python (pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib) – Data cleaning & statistical analysis.
✔ Jupyter Notebook – Exploratory data analysis (EDA) & regression modeling.
✔ GitHub – Version control & project documentation.

🔹 Analytical Steps:
1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation – Handling missing values & categorizing ingredients.
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Analyzing ratings distribution, cocoa percentages, and regional patterns.
3️⃣ Regression Analysis – Testing whether cocoa percentage predicts chocolate ratings.
4️⃣ Geospatial Analysis – Mapping average ratings by company location & bean origin country.
5️⃣ Ingredient Impact Analysis – Examining how different ingredient combinations affect ratings.
6️⃣ Results Interpretation & Business Recommendations – Providing actionable insights for stakeholders.

🔍 Key Findings & Insights
📌 Cocoa Percentage & Ratings
✔ Chocolates with 60–70% cocoa receive the highest ratings.
✔ 85%+ cocoa chocolates tend to have lower ratings, likely due to bitterness.

📌 Regional Influence on Chocolate Quality
✔ Highest-rated chocolates come from Nicaragua & Chile (3.75 avg.).
✔ Lowest-rated chocolates come from Puerto Rico, India, and China (2.625 avg.).
✔ Company location alone does not determine quality—some high-rated chocolates come from unexpected regions.

📌 Ingredient Impact on Ratings
✔ Chocolates with fewer ingredients (Beans, Sugar, Cocoa Butter) tend to score higher.
✔ Additives like Lecithin (L) and alternative sweeteners (S) are associated with lower ratings*.

📌 Top-Rated Chocolate Companies
✔ Tobago Estate (Pralus), Zokoko, and Ocelot are among the highest-rated brands.
✔ Artisanal brands tend to outperform mass-market chocolate producers.

⚠️ Limitations of the Study
🔸 Expert Reviews Only
✔ Ratings are based on expert opinions, which may not align with consumer preferences.

🔸 Too-Specific Bean Type Data
✔ The dataset includes highly detailed bean classifications and batch data, making analysis difficult.

🔸 Focus on Dark Chocolate Only
✔ The dataset primarily includes dark chocolate, excluding milk and white chocolate, which are widely consumed.

🔸 No Sales or Market Trends
✔ The dataset does not track sales data, consumer demand, or purchasing behavior over time.

📌 Recommendations & Future Research
💡 For Chocolate Makers:
✔ Focus on balanced cocoa content & high-quality ingredients rather than just maximizing cocoa %.
✔ Avoid *Lecithin (L) and artificial sweeteners (S)**, which may lower ratings.
✔ Offer milk, dark, and white chocolate to match market demand.

🔎 For Consumers:
✔ Consider brand reputation, ingredient quality, and regional trends, not just cocoa percentage.

📊 For Future Research:
✔ Compare expert ratings with customer reviews to understand preference differences.
✔ Analyze buying trends to see which chocolate types are most popular.
✔ Study price vs. rating correlation—are higher-rated chocolates always more expensive?
